<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="rounded"><img src="img/family1.jpg"></div>
  <div class="box1">
    <p>My name is <span class="highlight">Bryan Tapfer</span>, and I am a 39 year old person. My wife, Olivia, and I have two wonderful daughters, Marley and Charlotte. 
    We live in Southeast Portland, with our cat April, but are planning on moving next summer to Southwest Portland.
    I have been in the same job for the past <strong>20 years</strong>, but I have been stagnant for too long, and now
    am ready to move on to a new field of work that is more challenging, and rewarding. I have always had an affinity 
    for all things tech, so it made sense to get off my heels, and to jump into a new adventure in my work life.
